# UK Almanac App

## Overview

The project is to create a self-updating application which pulls data on UK performance. On areas such as the economy, health and transport. This will be presented in a dashboard in true Tropico style. Fans of the series will know what I mean... Statistics but with a bit of fun thrown in! As the project progresses, I hope it will serve as a dashboard app that gives users the trends and numbers that underpin the UK.
