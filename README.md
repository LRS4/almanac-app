# Almanac App

## Overview

The project is to create a self-updating application using RESTful APIs which pulls data on UK performance (economy, health, poverty and so on). This will be presented in a dashboard in true Tropico style. Fans of the series will know what I mean... Statistics but with a bit of fun thrown in!
